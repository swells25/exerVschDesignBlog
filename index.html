                        <ul>
                            <li>Llamas know their own limits. If you try to overload a llama with too much weight, the llama is likely to lie down or simply refuse to move.</li> 
                            <li>Llamas don't bite. They spit when they're agitated, but that's mostly at each other. Llamas also kick and neck wrestle each other when agitated.</li>
                            <li>Llama poop has almost no odor. Llama farmers refer to llama manure as "llama beans." It makes for a great, eco-friendly fertilizer. Historically, the Incas in Peru burned dried llama poop for fuel.</li>
                            <li>Llamas have been used as guard animals for livestock like sheep or even alpacas in North America since the '80s. They require almost no training to be an effective guard.</li>

                        <p>I may have found the most important, albeit hilarious movie, on the face of the planet, <b>LLAMAGEDDEN!!!!!!!!!!</b>.</p>
                        <p>I don't think I have laughed so hard in my life and all I watched was the trailer. All that popped into my head as I watched is what in the world? At this point I don't know If I could handle watching it without peeing my pants, but should I even try?</p>

                        <p>I quite enjoy llama facts. I learn something new about them everytime I research them. I have a couple different websites that I visit, as well as, Instagram and pinterest pages. Where do you get your llama "info" or Llamafo?</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Llamas are members of the camelid family meaning they're pretty closely related to vicu√±as and camels.</li> 
                            <li>Llamas weigh between 280 and 450 pounds and can carry 25 to 30 percent of their body weight, so a 400-pound male llama can carry about 100 to 120 pounds on a trek of 10 to 12 miles with no problem.</li>
                            <li>Llamas come in a range of solid and spotted colors including black, gray, beige, brown, red, and white.</li>
                            <li>The current population of llamas and alpacas in South America is estimated to be more than 7 million.</li> 
                        </ul>
                        <p class="span-all">This is some cool stuff don't you think?</p>
